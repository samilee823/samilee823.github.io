        <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Samantha, and I love Disney, dark chocolate, and biking. I am originally from Massachusetts, but Orlando is now my home. I am a dog person, but I have never had a dog myself. I had guinea pigs when I was growing up!</p>
        <p>When I'm not at Walt Disney World, you can find me traveling the world. I have been to 21 countries including: Japan, South Africa, Ireland, Mexico, The Netherlands, the UK, and I hope to add many more!</p>
        <p> I am learning to code with Code Skool. I am hoping to help my mom update her e-commerce website, and one day I hope to lead a computer engineering team. This is my first of many steps. Pray for me.</p>
